## What is this ?

This is the source for Keith Packard's [ao-dbg](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty//man1/ao-dbg.1.html) extracted from
the Altus Metrum high power model rocketry operating system's source code.  

See http://altusmetrum.org/ for more information about Altus Metrum's products.

## Status

The code here builds, but is untested. 

My intention was to add debugger support to [cc-tool](https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool) and somehow interface it to this code but so far that project hasn't been started.
